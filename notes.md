# Notes

## HTML

Document Object Model represents your page. (DOM)
HTML defines the content and structure
css styles it
javascript can interact and modify the DOM

Some tags:
body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span
<br />a href="" alt=""
<br />img src="" width=

## CSS
selector (body, p, span, #id, .class, etc)

## Javascript
can be included in 3 ways: in attribute thing, in <script></script> and in seperate javascript page
functions: named, anonymous, and arrows

"Syntax is the least important thing"

iterating: `in` means index/keys, `of` means value

JSON is like objects, but only strings. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(obj_jason)

### Promises
new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve(true))
